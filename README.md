Xcode Themes
============

There's not much to see here at the moment, as I've used the CSSEdit theme on and off for about 5 years, and always come back to it — it's so bright, colourful and easy on the eyes!

### CSSEdit Tribute Colour Theme
This colour theme is heavily inspired by the text editor theme from [MacRabbit's][MR] excellent (but now defunct) CSSEdit. I like to serve it with a side of [14pt Meslo LG DZ][Meslo].
