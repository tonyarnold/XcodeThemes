Xcode Themes
============

There's not much to see here at the moment, as I've used the CSSEdit theme on and off for about 5 years, and always come back to it â€” it's so bright, colourful and easy on the eyes!

### CSSEdit Tribute Colour Theme
This colour theme is heavily inspired by the text editor theme from [MacRabbit's][MR] excellent CSSEdit, which now lives inside [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/). I like to serve it with a side of [14pt Meslo LG DZ][Meslo]. Thanks to Jan Van Boghout for letting me use his amazing mix of colours!
